To run PowerCLI cmdlets on vSphere and perform administration or monitoring tasks, first establish a

connection to an ESX instance or a vCenter Server.
Prerequisites
If you use a proxy server for the connection, verify that it is configured properly, so that the connection is kept
alive long enough for long PowerCLI tasks to complete running.
NOTE You can remove a proxy by running Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -ProxyPolicy NoProxy.

Procedure
Run Connect-VIServer with the server name and valid credentials.
Connect-VIServer -Server esx3.example.com -Protocol http -User admin -Password pass
