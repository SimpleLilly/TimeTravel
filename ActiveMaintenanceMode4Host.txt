To complete some specific administration tasks, you might need to activate maintenance mode for a host. On
vSphere, you can activate maintenance mode by using the Set-VMHost cmdlet.
Prerequisites
Connect to a vSphere server.
Procedure
1 Save the Host host object as a variable.
$host = Get-VMHost -Name Host
2 Get the cluster to which Host belongs and save the cluster object as a variable.
$hostCluster = Get-Cluster -VMHost $host
3 Start a task that activates maintenance mode for the Host host and save the task object as a variable.
$updateHostTask = Set-VMHost -VMHost $host -State "Maintenance" -RunAsync
NOTE If the host is not automated or is partially automated and has powered-on virtual machines running
on it, you must specify the RunAsync parameter and wait until all powered-on virtual machines are
relocated or powered off before applying DRS recommendations.
4 Get and apply the recommendations generated by DRS.
Get-DrsRecommendation -Cluster $hostCluster | where {$_.Reason -eq "Host is entering
maintenance mode"} | Apply-DrsRecommendation
5 Get the task output object and save it as a variable.
$myUpdatedHost = Wait-Task $updateHostTask
