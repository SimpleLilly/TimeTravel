By using PowerCLI cmdlets, you can automate creating different inventory objects on vSphere.
Prerequisites
Connect to a vSphere server.
Procedure
1 Get the inventory root folder and create a new folder called Folder in it.
$folder = Get-Folder -NoRecursion | New-Folder -Name Folder
2 Create a new datacenter called DC in the Folder folder.
New-Datacenter -Location $folder -Name DC
3 Create a folder called Folder1 under DC.
Get-Datacenter DC | New-Folder -Name Folder1
$folder1 = Get-Folder -Name Folder1
4 Create a new cluster Cluster1 in the Folder1 folder.
New-Cluster -Location $folder1 -Name Cluster1 -DrsEnabled -DrsAutomationLevel FullyAutomated
DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler) is a feature that allows automatic allocation of cluster resources.
5 Add a host in the cluster by using the Add-VMHost command, and provide credentials when prompted.
$host1 = Add-VMHost -Name 10.23.112.345 -Location ( Get-Cluster Cluster1 )
6 Create a resource pool in the cluster's root resource pool.
$myClusterRootRP = Get-ResourcePool -Location ( Get-Cluster Cluster1 ) -Name Resources
New-ResourcePool -Location $clusterRootRP -Name MyRP01 -CpuExpandableReservation $true -
CpuReservationMhz 500 -CpuSharesLevel high -MemExpandableReservation $true -MemReservationMB
500 -MemSharesLevel high
7 Create a virtual machine asynchronously.
$vmCreationTask = New-VM -Name VM2 -VMHost $host1 -ResourcePool MyRP01 -DiskMB 4000 -MemoryMB
256 -RunAsync
The RunAsync parameter specifies that the command runs asynchronously. This means that in contrast to
a synchronous operation, you do not have to wait for the process to complete before supplying the next
command at the command line.
